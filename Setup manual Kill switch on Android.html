<p>With advent of powerful mobile devices, especially on an open 
platform like Android, people are using it for multi-tasking like 
download torrents, accessing Netflix, BBC etc online.</p>
<p>For a very long time, there has been a constant struggle for developing a <strong>Kill switch</strong>
 on Android with VPN apps owing to the limited access to the core 
system. Although starting with Android Nougat 7+, Android OS now comes 
with a dedicated <strong>VPN killswitch.</strong> If do not wish to expose yourself while switching networks or owing to an abrupt disconnection. Kindly continue.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 - Disconnect from PrivateVPN App</strong></p>
<p>Disconnect from PrivateVPN app and make sure the server you wish to connect to is select from Server list in homescreen of App.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this guide, I am guide I am going to use PrivateVPN’s Icelandic VPN.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2 - Configure Android system settings for persistent connection and kill switch</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to Android’s Settings - <em>Wireless &amp; networks</em> - <em>VPN</em> page as shown in the image below.</p>

<p>Click on gears like icon to the right of <strong>PrivateVPN</strong> label to enter PrivateVPN app specific settings for VPN as seen in the image below.</p>
<p><img src="Setup%20manual%20Kill%20switch%20on%20Android_files/Screenshot_20180420-134714.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>Enable/toggle <strong>Always-on VPN</strong> option to <strong>ON</strong> as seen in the image below.</p>
<p><img src="Setup%20manual%20Kill%20switch%20on%20Android_files/Screenshot_20180420-140323.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>Make sure you get VPN connection as seen in the image below.</p>
<p><img src="Setup%20manual%20Kill%20switch%20on%20Android_files/Screenshot_20180420-1403042.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>Once you have a VPN connection. Enable/toggle <strong>Block connections without VPN</strong> to <strong>ON</strong> as seen in the image below.</p>
<p><img src="Setup%20manual%20Kill%20switch%20on%20Android_files/Screenshot_20180420-1405152.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Android OS, will prompt you a question, tap <strong>TURN ON</strong> to finally enable your manual killswitch for VPN. See the image below.</p>
<p><img src="Setup%20manual%20Kill%20switch%20on%20Android_files/Screenshot_20180420-140333.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Voila! You have successfully deployed a manual killswitch on 
your Android phone with PrivateVPN app for Android. It can also be done 
with OpenVPN for Android App.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 - Testing your manual Kill switch</strong></p>
<p>Goto PrivateVPN app and Disconnect the VPN connection from there and 
check if you still have any Internet access on your Android device.</p>
<p>Also try switch Wifi networks or from Wifi to Mobile data and 
vice-versa and check if you can access Internet unless you connect to 
VPN by navigating to PrivateVPN app or OpenVPN for Android app manually.</p>
<p>In my testing, this method is robust and blocks all Internet access 
without a valid VPN connection via PrivateVPN app or OpenVPN for Android
 App, whatever is configured for kill switch.</p>

<p><em>Deploy it on your own Android device and enjoy robust kill switch
 protection on your Android Nougat (7+) or newer device right now.</em></p>
